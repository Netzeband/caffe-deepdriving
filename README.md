# DeepDriving-Caffe

This is a fork of the original caffe repository at https://github.com/BVLC/caffe. It integrates changes needed for the DeepDriving project, which is originally located at http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/.


***I'm not the inventor of DeepDriving, I just use it as base for my own investigations on Deep Learning.***

For further details see the instructions:
* [Install Caffe on Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/Netzeband/DeepDriving-caffe/wiki/Install)
* [Visualize the Trainings Data](https://github.com/Netzeband/DeepDriving-caffe/wiki/CheckDatabase)
* [Drive in Torcs](https://github.com/Netzeband/DeepDriving-caffe/wiki/Test)
* [Verify the Database](https://github.com/Netzeband/DeepDriving-caffe/wiki/ErrorMeas)

***Attention: Work in progress. Only inference works so far.***
